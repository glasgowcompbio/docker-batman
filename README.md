docker-batman
=============

This docker image provides BATMAN [1] running on top of Ubuntu 16.04 and R-Studio, used for the Bayesian analysis of 1D-NMR data. It seems a bit difficult to get BATMAN to compile on the latest OSX version, so I created this container .. Also included in this image is Anaconda Python, alongside libraries commonly used for data analysis (numpy, etc.).

To build this image:

    $ docker build -t joewandy/docker-batman .

To install and run the image, use the following command from the shell:

    $ docker run \
    -v /Users/joewandy/git/pyBatman:/home/rstudio/NMR/codes \
    -v /Users/joewandy/Dropbox/Meta_clustering/NMR/data/test_spectra/:/home/rstudio/NMR/spectra \
    -v /Users/joewandy/Dropbox/Meta_clustering/NMR/data/background/:/home/rstudio/NMR/background \
    -v /Users/joewandy/Dropbox/Meta_clustering/NMR/results/:/home/rstudio/NMR/results \
    --name batman -d -p 8787:8787 -p 9999:9999 joewandy/docker-batman

Explanation of the command above:
- `-v xxxx:yyyy` maps the host folder xxxx to yyyy in the container. You need to map the 'spectra', 'background', 'results' and 'codes' folders from your host to the container. These are where the pipeline will look for the Bruker spectra to process, the background signal to use for background correction, where to place the results and find the Python codes required to run the pipeline.
- `--name batman` gives the running container the name 'batman'.
- `-d` runs the container in a detached mode.
- `-dp 8787:8787` maps port 8787 in the host to port 8787 in the container, similarly `-dp 9999:9999` maps port 9999.
- `joewandy/docker-batman` specifies the name of the docker image to pull from dockerhub.

To attach to the shell in the running container

    $ docker exec -it batman /bin/bash

And finally to access R-studio in the running container, go to `http://localhost:8787/` in the browser and log in using the username 'rstudio' and password 'rstudio'. To access Jupyter notebook in the container, go to `http://localhost:9999`.
